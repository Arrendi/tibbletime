Description: Built on top of the tibble package, tibbletime is an extension
    that allows for the creation of time aware tibbles. Some immediate 
    advantages of this include: the ability to perform time based subsetting 
    on tibbles, quickly summarising and aggregating results by time periods, 
    and calling functions similar in spirit to the map family from purrr 
    on time based tibbles.
