## A time aware tibble

Built on top of the `tidyverse`, `tibbletime` is an extension
that allows for the creation of _time aware tibbles_ through the setting of 
a time index. 

Some immediate advantages of this include: 

1) The ability to perform compact time-based subsetting on tibbles.

2) Partitioning an index column by time (like
yearly, monthly, every 2 weeks, etc.) so that you can use `dplyr`'s grouped
functionality to summarise and aggregate by time period.

3) Changing the periodicity of a time-based tibble. This allows easily changing 
from a daily dataset to a monthly or yearly dataset.

4) All functions were designed to support the pipe and to work with packages
like `dplyr` and `tidyr`. Each function has also been designed to work with
`dplyr::group_by()` allowing for powerful data manipulation.

5) Modifying functions for rolling analysis.

6) Quickly creating `tbl_time` time series objects.

7) Full support for `Date` and `POSIXct` index columns, and experimental 
support for `yearmon`, `yearqtr` and `hms` which should become more stable
as some issues in `dplyr` are worked out.

## Installation

Development Version:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("business-science/tibbletime")
```

CRAN Version: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tibbletime")
```

## Major update warning

If you have been using `0.0.2`, the update to `0.1.0` has introduced 
major breaking changes. This was necessary for long term stability of the package,
and no attempt to support backwards compatability was made at this early 
stage in development. We apologize for any issues this causes.
See NEWS for complete details.

## Getting started

The first thing to do is to turn your `tibble` into a `tbl_time` object.
Notice the specification of the `index` as the `date` column of `FB`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tibbletime)
library(dplyr)

# Facebook stock prices. Comes with the package
data(FB)

# Convert FB to tbl_time
FB <- as_tbl_time(FB, index = date)

FB
```

There are a number of functions that were designed specifically for `tbl_time`
objects. Some of them are:

1) `filter_time()` - Succinctly filter a tbl_time object by date.

4) `as_period()` - Convert a tbl_time object from daily to monthly, 
from minute data to hourly, and more. This allows the user to easily 
aggregate data to a less granular level.

2) `collapse_index()` - Take an index column, and collapse it so that all
observations in an interval share the same date. The most common use of this
is to then group on this column with `dplyr::group_by()` and perform 
time-based calculations with `summarise()`, `mutate()` or any other `dplyr`
function.

5) `partition_index()` - A lower level version of `collapse_index()`. Rather
than collapse the index directly, this returns a column of integers that 
correspond to the groups.

6) `rollify()` - Modify a function so that it calculates a value 
(or a set of values) at specific time intervals. This can be used for rolling
averages and other rolling calculations inside the `tidyverse` framework.

7) `create_series()` - Use shorthand notation to quickly 
initialize a `tbl_time` object containing a `date` column 
with a regularly spaced time series.

To look at just a few:

```{r}
# Filter for dates from March 2013 to December 2015
FB %>% 
  filter_time('2013-03' ~ '2015')

# Change from daily to monthly periodicity
# This just reduces the tibble to the last row in each month
FB %>% 
  as_period("monthly", side = "end")

# Maybe you don't want to lose the rest of the month's information,
# and instead you'd like to take the average of every column for each month
FB %>%
  select(-symbol) %>%
  mutate(date = collapse_index(date, "monthly", side = "end")) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise_all(mean)

# Perform a 5 period rolling average
mean_5 <- rollify(mean, window = 5)
mutate(FB, roll_mean = mean_5(adjusted))

# Create a time series
# Every other day in 2013
create_series(~'2013', '2 day')
```

## Grouping

Groups created through `dplyr::group_by()` are supported throughout the package.
Because `collapse_index()` is just adding a column you can group on, all
dplyr functions are supported.

```{r}
# Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google stocks
data(FANG)

# Summarise by period and by group
FANG %>% 
  as_tbl_time(date) %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  
  # Collapse to yearly
  mutate(date = collapse_index(date, "yearly")) %>%
  
  # Additionally group by date (yearly)
  group_by(date, add = TRUE) %>%
  
  # Perform a yearly summary for each symbol
  summarise(
    adj_min   = min(adjusted),
    adj_max   = max(adjusted),
    adj_range = adj_max - adj_min
  )
```

## Index order

`tibbletime` assumes that your dates are in _ascending order_. A warning will
be generated if they are not when you use a function where order is relevant. We do
this for speed purposes and to not force a change on the user's dataset by sorting
for them.
