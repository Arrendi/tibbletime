## Release Summary
This is the third release of tibbletime. This is a major release for the package
and includes a number of breaking changes that have been well documented in the
NEWS file. The changes promote a more flexible use with the dplyr package, and
at this early stage in the package lifecycle no attempt at backwards compat was
made. Users have been warned of this already, and initial feedback of the 
github development version has been positive.
