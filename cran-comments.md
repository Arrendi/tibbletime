## Release Summary

This is a minor release of 'tibbletime'. It fixes a few small bugs regarding
the new version of 'tibble', and changes a test in preparation for 
'dplyr' 0.8.0.

I have also changed the maintainer email to reflect a job change.

* ubuntu 14.04.5 (on travis-ci) (3.4.4, devel, release)
* win-builder (devel and release)
